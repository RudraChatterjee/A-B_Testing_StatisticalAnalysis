E-news Express, an online news portal, is looking expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. The company has designed a new landing page to attract new subscribers. This python based project performs exploratory data analysis, data visualization and conducts a no of statistical tests on the customer data to determine key business insights on the following questions:

(1) Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?

(2) Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?

(3) Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?

(4) Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?
